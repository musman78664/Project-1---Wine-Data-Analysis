# Project-1---Wine-Data-Analysis

Wine data analysis using https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews.

Setup

I am using kaggle's api to download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews. In order to run this code you need to install kaggle using "pip install kaggle".

Then you'll need to create an api_key file by registering on the https://www.kaggle.com. Once you have done that go to > My Account on the top right of the web page and click Create New Api Token. This will generate a file kaggle.json and download it to your downloads folder. You'll need to create a .kaggle folder inside your /User/Username directory and store the kaggle.json file in that folder. Once you've done this you'll be able to run the code in the notebook file.

The .kaggle folder you generate will by default be hidden. You will need to show hidden files in the directory if you are unable to see it to move file kaggle.json file to it. Otherwise you can run a terminal cmd to move the file. mv kaggle.json ../User/username/.kaggle
